# Premier League Quiz

### Objective 

The objective of this project was to create a fun premier league quiz to test the users knowledge of past and present premier league stats and find the true Premier league quiz master! The aim when designing this quiz was to make it easy to use and navigate for the user and to provide feedback on the correct answer and a score counter.

### Bugs

I ran into a bug when adding the score counter to my quiz. A user is able to keep clicking the correct answer before clicking the next button and increasing their correct score counter as many as they would like. This is obviously a big issue as the user can skew their results. 

To fix this issue my first thought is to remove the next question button and have the quiz automatically load the next question when the answer is given. This removes the oppertunity for a user to keep submitting their answer ad increasing the scores.
