### Bugs

I ran into a bug when adding the score counter to my quiz. A user is able to keep clicking the correct answer before clicking the next button and increasing their correct score counter as many as they would like. This is obviously a big issue as the user can skew their results. 

To fix this issue my first thought is to remove the next question button and have the quiz automatically load the next question when the answer is given. This removes the oppertunity for a user to keep submitting their answer ad increasing the scores.
